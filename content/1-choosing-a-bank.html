					<p>When choosing a bank, you must consider both how often you will go to the bank and the amount of time 
						you are willing to spend driving to and from the nearest branch. A branch close to your home or job is 
						more beneficial than a branch farther away or where traffic may prevent you from getting there quickly. 
						The reason this should be important to you is that in case that you need to deposit money to cover an 
						overdraft, sign a stop-payment form, or close an account due to fraud, you will be able to do so as quickly 
						as possible, preventing you from potentially losing money.</p>
					<p>You should also consider how their hours of operation work with your schedule. If a branch is near your 
						home but closes before you arrive home from work, you may want to find a bank closer to work or with longer 
						operating hours.</p>

				<h2>1.2: Number of Branches vs. Customer Service</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
					<p>In addition to finding a bank near you, you will need to consider how many branches exist around your area 
						and across the country. Typically, this translates to deciding between a small, local bank or a larger, more 
						corporate organization. Each comes with its own pros and cons.</p>
					<p>Local banks, such as Woodhaven National or Southwest Bank, typically have fewer branches and are centrally 
						located around a main operations branch. For example, Woodhaven has eight branches spread across the DFW Metroplex. 
						Local banks often offer slightly lower interest rates, but can more closely monitor your accounts for possible 
						fraud. Many small banks avoid "selling" to their customers (i.e., pushing new accounts to new and existing 
						customers to satisfy quotas).</p>
					<p>Larger corporate banks, such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo, will have branches located all across the 
						country and even in foreign countries. Having so many branches available is helpful if issues arise while on 
						vacation or traveling. The downsides of the larger banks are that the experience you receive will be less 
						personalized to your needs and you may not be able to speak to an employee without going to a branch. Many of 
						the bigger branches use automated phone-based customer support. </p>

				<h2>1.3: Minimum Balances</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
					<p>Next, you will want to consider the amount of money required to open an account as well as 
						the minimum balance needed to avoid fees and service charges. The amount of money you currently 
						have and the amount of money tied up by these balance requirements may determine whether or not 
						you choose a particular account. Ideally, you want one with either no minimum or a very low 
						minimum, such as $25 or $50. </p>

				<h2>1.4: Monthly Fees and Service Fees</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>Typically related directly to the minimum balance requirements, monthly fees and 
						service fees are calculated and charged differently at each bank. </p>
					<p>One way of assessing the imposition of fees is to calculate the total daily balance 
						for each statement cycle. If the daily balance falls below a predetermined amount on 
						any given day in a statement cycle, the bank adds a fee to that month's statement. The 
						fee can vary by bank, as well as by the severity of the difference in your daily balance 
						versus the predetermined minimum. For example, say Bank A imposes a minimum daily balance 
						requirement of $1,000. The bank charges an account in which the balance falls below $500 
						on any given day of the statement cycle a fee of $8. However, if an account's balance only 
						falls between $500 and $750, Bank A reduces the fee to $5 for that statement cycle.</p>
					<p>Other banks may charge a flat fee on all accounts of a certain type, but may allow customers 
						incentives to reduce that fee by completing certain actions. For example, say Bank B charges a 
						monthly flat fee of $7 on all "Select 4 Checking" accounts. Customers can sign up for online 
						banking to reduce the fee by $2 and set up direct deposit to lower the fee another $2. Thus, 
						the customer could reduce the fee to as little as $3 per month. </p>
					<p>Additional service fees may come from having cashier's checks or money orders printed, wiring 
						funds to another bank, or replacing lost ATM cards. These fees also vary by bank, so it is 
						important to research such conditions before signing up for an account. </p>

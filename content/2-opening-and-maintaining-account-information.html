				<p>When you first open your account, you will be asked to sign a signature card. It is important that you 
					use the same signature on that card as you would when you sign checks or for credit card transactions 
					(e.g., at restaurants), because that signature will be compared to your signatures on checks cashed by 
					others and for goods and services you purchase with your bank card.</p>
				<p>A common mistake people make during the signing process is signing official documents (e.g., drivers' 
					licenses, bank agreements, apartment leases) with a nicer signature than they use on a daily basis. This 
					causes issues because when writing a check in a hurry, the signature tends to get messy. Having a messy 
					signature is not inherently bad if it is not easily replicated; however, if you sign your bank paperwork 
					differently, you could cause yourself payment issues. </p>
				<p>First, your checks or purchases might be declined, or you may be interrupted by phone calls from the 
					bank's fraud department. Additionally, if your signature changes dramatically from one transaction to the 
					next, the bank may accidentally pay checks you did not write. The bank may accidentally pay a fraudulent 
					check because the customer frequently changes their signature, and they cannot find a justification for 
					returning it.</p>

			<h3>2.2: Setting Up Direct Deposit</h3>
			<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
				<p>When you get a new job or a new account, you need to make sure you are getting paid in the most effective 
					way possible. Larger companies often offer direct deposit because it simplifies their accounting. They can 
					ensure that payroll gets processed immediately and that their employees do not hold on to their paper checks 
					for long periods.</p>
				<p>Direct deposit benefits employees by allowing them to access their funds as soon as they deposit rather 
					than making them wait for a paper check to process through the paying bank. Some banks may even place holds 
					on checks being deposited for the first time or that are larger than the balance of the account into which 
					they are being deposited. (We will explain these holds in greater depth in Chapter 3.) Additionally, direct 
					deposit usually allows pay to be split between different accounts, like between checking and savings, which 
					may help you save money more effectively.</p>
				<p>There are two ways to set up direct deposit:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Voided Check - </b>You can write "VOID" across the face of the check so that it can only be used 
						to gain your account number and the bank's routing number. Since your account may be new and you will 
						not yet have official checks, most banks will give you temporary checks for this purpose. Make sure to 
						check with your employer regarding whether they accept temps for direct deposit. (We will talk more about 
						this in Chapter 4.)</li>
					<li><b>Bank Authorization Letterhead - </b>Most banks can provide an official letter stating that you have 
						an account and are authorizing payroll to be deposited directly into the account. They will provide your 
						account number and their routing number.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Both methods give your banking information to your employer, but you should check with the company about which 
					one they prefer or accept.</p>

			<h3>2.3: Designating a Person Payable on Death (POD)</h3>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>If you are unmarried, you should designate a beneficiary on any account you open. A beneficiary or POD is 
					a person you designate who will receive any funds in your account should you pass away. Most young people do 
					not consider this necessary, or feel it is something only the elderly need to think about. However, accidents 
					do happen, and you want to ensure that your money is not tied up by a bank or by any legal action resulting 
					from your death. While a morbid subject, it is nonetheless important to designate someone POD. This information 
					can be updated as often as necessary, and they do not have to come to the bank with you. All you need in order 
					to sign someone as the POD is their Social Security number, their name, and a contact number.</p>
				<p>PODs cannot access to your account unless you pass away. Some common misconceptions about PODs are that they 
					can withdraw funds from your account without your permission, ask for balances, or use your debit card. These 
					are all incorrect. If you want someone to be able to access funds while you are still alive, you need to add 
					them as an additional signer, which is a completely different process.</p>

					debit cards, checks, or bank statements. If your account number gets compromised, most banks are required to 
					immediately close the account and transfer all funds to another. If you have several automatic payments set up, 
					you will have to call each company and update the payment information to make sure your bills get paid correctly

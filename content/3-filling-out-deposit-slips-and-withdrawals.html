					<p>As a new account holder, you may not be familiar with all the forms you may need to fill out, including 
						withdrawal slips and deposits. Knowing how to fill these forms out properly helps both you and the teller 
						complete the transaction quickly and accurately.</p>
					<p>Important information to write on any form you fill out for bank transactions include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Your Account Number</b>
							<p>It can be hard to remember that long string of numbers, so try memorizing just the last four digits. 
							Banks often use the same numerical sequence at the beginning of account numbers. Even if you cannot 
							remember the entire account number, having the last four digits often enables a teller to locate your 
							account quickly.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Your name as it appears on the account</b>
							<p>If you go by Bob, but your legal name is Robert, write Robert on the slip.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Your address</b>
							<p>Two customers may share a name like "Robert Smith," and this additional information 
							allows the teller to identify which is the correct account. </p>

				<h2>3.2: Straight Deposits</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
					<p>
						When you make deposits without getting cash back, bank employees call these straight deposits, because 
						the funds are going straight into the account.
					</p>
					<p>
						To fill out a deposit for which you do not want to receive cash back:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Step 1</b>
							<p>
								Write the amount for each check you are depositing in the column on the far right side of the form. 
								You may include check numbers, names, or any reference info you want to the left of the amounts.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step 2</b>
							<p>
								Write in the amount of cash you are depositing in the column next to "cash." If there is no specific 
								"cash" column, write it in the reference section. Count your cash before you hand it to the teller. If a 
								discrepancy between your count and the teller's arises, it will be easier for you to verify where the mistake 
								happened. Never rely on the teller to tell you how much cash you have. This will protect both you from losing 
								money to an unethical employee and the teller from possible errors that could cost them their job.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step 3</b>
							<p>
								Add the total for the combined checks and cash and write that amount in the box labeled "total" at the bottom of the form.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step 4</b>
							<p>
								Be sure you sign the back of each check in the proper place. Banks usually refer to this as an endorsement. 
								Endorsing the check is important because once your bank sends the check for collection to the paying bank, 
								the paying bank will want to verify that the correct person is accepting the funds. If you fail to sign the 
								check, the other bank may not honor the funds and will debit the amount of that check, which could cause you 
								to overdraw your account. You may include your account number or driver's license number under your signature 
								if you like. Doing so ensures that if the checks become separated from the deposit slip, they can be put together 
								again and processed quickly.

			<div class="row section" id="3-cashback-deposits">
				<h2>3.3: Cashback Deposits</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>
						For deposits for which you take cash back, you will complete the same steps as required for straight 
						deposits, but in addition you will:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Write the amount of cash you want in the "cash back" column and subtract it from the total of the checks.</p></li>
						<li><p>Sign for the cash back.</p></li>
						<li>
							<p>Count your cash immediately after getting it back.</p>
							<p>
								You do not want to get home and realize that the 
								teller gave you too little money or too much. If the amount is incorrect, be patient and calmly notify the 
								teller that you believe they made an error. If you are in the drive-thru, you may want to park and go inside, 
								since tellers will typically need to recount their drawers to verify that they made a mistake. If you are in 
								a hurry, make sure the teller or their supervisor has a contact number where they can reach you. To correct a 
								shortage, the teller may deposit the funds into your account (or debit your account if you received too much). 
								The bank should always notify you of any such change.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Withdraw no more than the amount of money that is already in your account.</p>
							<p>
								You may be depositing a check for 
								$2,000, but if you currently only have $200 in the bank, they may not allow you to take $500 cash back. 
								This is done to ensure that if your check is returned unpaid, you will not overdraw your account and be charged 
								fees. You may find this unfair, since after all you are depositing $2,000. However, accessing funds that are 
								not available could cost you significantly. Current industry charges for checks that overdraw your account average 
								about $30 per overdraft. That adds up rather quickly if you have written multiple checks expecting that the check 
								you deposited will clear.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Whether you are getting cash back or not, always check your receipts for the correct total. It is always better to 
						catch an error the day it is made rather than a month later when you get your statement in the mail.

			<!-- Section 4 -->
			<div class="row section" id="4-large-deposit-holds">
				<h2>3.4: Large Deposit Holds</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>
						Sometimes, when you are depositing a large item or a check you have not previously deposited, the bank will decide to place a hold on the check. A "large item" is considered either any amount greater than the amount you have in your account or an amount higher than what you typically deposit. The reason banks place holds on these checks is to ensure the other bank pays them. It can sometimes take up to a week for the check to process through the other bank and be returned to your bank.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because customers complain that they are not being allowed to access their funds, we want to clarify how the process of holding funds works and why it benefits you individually. If you deposit a large check and the bank gives you immediate credit, which you then spend before the check clears the original bank, your account may become overdrawn when your bank then must retract the credit they gave you. Also, any checks you write off of that check may be returned unpaid. Before you know it, overdraft fees will further overdraw the account, and people will call you to collect on the debts you now owe them.
					</p>
					<p>
						Conversely, if the bank places a hold on a check, you will not be able to spend the funds until they are truly collected from the paying bank. If the check comes back unpaid, you will not incur those overdraw fees (unless your account was already overdrawn). Because the bank placed a hold on the check, you were protected from losing additional money.
					</p>
					<p>Some reasons banks place holds:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The check amount is higher than your current balance</li>
						<li>The check amount is higher than your average deposit </li>
						<li>The check has previously been returned unpaid</li>
						<li>The check is a "credit check"</li>
						<li>The check appears to have been altered in some way</li>
						<li>The check is missing endorsements, or said endorsements cannot be verified</li>

						If a check you deposit is returned unpaid, you will receive a new copy of the check from the paying bank to be run again. Checks returned due to insufficient funds can be rerun two times, giving you three total chances to gather your funds. After using those three chances, you will have to request a new check from the original person paying you. If a check is returned due to missing signatures, closed account, or stopped payments, you must immediately have to request a new check.

						Credit checks are checks issued by credit card companies. They are typically meant to transfer credit balances from other credit cards. Because credit checks do not usually include any information about the credit line they draw on, your bank cannot verify the actual amount of credit being offered by the credit company. Someone can potentially write a credit check for more than the amount they can borrow. If you receive a credit check as payment for something like yard work, babysitting, or a car you sold, be aware that the bank will definitely put a hold on it.

					<p>
						Another thing to keep in mind when withdrawing is the amount you want to receive and the denominations you prefer. It is a common misconception that banks keep a lot of money in their vaults. In truth, each branch establishes a limit on the amount of cash they can keep. Limits are set by the bank's board of directors and are based on the amount insurance will cover and the amount of normal cash business each branch expects to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, most banks only receive shipments of cash from the Federal Reserve one or two times a week. Orders must be placed two (2) days prior to the delivery day. If you plan to take a large sum of cash and want specific denominations, it is always best to call your bank ahead of time and ask if they have enough money to accommodate you. If they do not have the money, they can quickly place an order or call another local branch and see if you can retrieve the money there. (These suggestions also apply to change orders for rolled coins.)

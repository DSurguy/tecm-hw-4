				<h1>Chapter 5: Balancing Your Account</h1>
				<p>Keeping track of your spending is an important part of owning a bank account because it helps prevent fraud or may alert you to fraud earlier. You will also have smoother transactions at the bank and be less likely to overdraw your account. </p>
			</div>

			<!-- Section 1 -->
			<div class="row section" id="1-how-overdraft-works">
				<h2>5.1: How Overdraft Works</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
					<p>Overdrafts occur when a transaction made to an account leaves the account with a negative balance. There are three different types of overdraft protection available to a customer.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Opting Out</b>
							<p>If a debit transaction will leave an account with a negative balance, the transaction will be denied at the time of purchase (i.e., the card is declined at the cash register.) You will not incur a fee for declined transactions, but you will need to find a different way to pay. If a transaction conducted by check will overdraw the account, it will be returned unpaid and you will incur a "returned item fee." This fee varies depending on your bank, but typically ranges between $20 and $30.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Overdraft Transfer</b>
							<p>Many banks provide <a href="#2-more-about-linked-accounts">linked accounts</a>. With this option, you can link a second account to your checking account. Then, if the checking account overdrafts, money will be transferred from the second account to the checking account. The bank will still charge a fee, but it will be less than the fee for a returned item.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Overdraft Coverage</b>
							<p>If a transaction leaves the account with a negative balance, the bank will cover the transaction up to a certain amount. Ask your bank about your individual limit. Under overdraft coverage, your purchase will go through or the check trying to clear will be paid, but you will then need to pay the bank back. Most banks charge a flat overdraft fee for each transaction. Some banks may limit the number of transactions that get this flat overdraft fee and can charge a fee for each day that the account sits at a negative balance.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Overdrawing an account can lead to expensive fees that can leave you in debt to the bank. To limit the risk of overdrawing, keep a balanced checkbook. Check your account daily to make sure that charges are posting accurately and that there are no fraudulent charges that could lead to an overdraft.</p>
					<p>While these preventives are great, it is important also have a plan if an overdraft happens. The simplest and cheapest way to deal with overdrafts is by linking accounts.</p>

			<div class="row section" id="2-more-about-linked-accounts">
				<h2>5.2: More About Linked Accounts</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12"> <!-- Body -->
					<p>Linking accounts is the most cost-effective way to manage overdrafts and keep fees to a minimum. However, there are some drawbacks to linking accounts. One is that you must link accounts of the same bank together. By doing this, you cannot pick separate banks for checking and savings, which could lead to missing out on benefits such as higher interest rates for savings. Keeping your money in the same bank may not allow you to insure all your funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures the funds in your account up to $250,000.</p>
					<p>FDIC insurance covers all deposit accounts, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Checking accounts</li>
						<li>Savings accounts</li>
						<li>Money market deposit accounts</li>
						<li>Certificates of deposit (CDs)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category. This means that if you have $250,000 in a checking account and another $250,000 in a savings account, you will not be covered for both accounts separately because the account ownership is the same. To insure funds in both accounts, you have to name a POD or secondary signer. That person is then also covered up to $250,000.</p>
					<p>Another drawback of linking accounts is that you can quickly deplete your savings account if you do not monitor your spending.</p>

				<h2>5.3: Handling Errors and Disputing Fraudulent Charges</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>No system is perfect, and bank errors do happen, but it is important to know how to handle these errors. This is the real world, not Monopoly. If the bank does make an error in your favor, you are not allowed to keep it. Keeping misappropriated money could lead to fines or jail time. If you have money that is misappropriated, do not move or spend it. Whether the error is in your favor or not, you must immediately report it. </p>
					<p>If you find an error:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Call the bank immediately and report the error. The sooner it is reported, the sooner the bank can look for solutions. </li>
						<li>Keep notes on who you talked to and a brief description of what the conversation was about. </li>
						<li>Remain patient while the error is fixed, but keep in touch with the bank until the matter is settled and all funds have been returned to the appropriate place.</li>
						<li>Be aware that some fees may accrue as a result of the error. If the error occurred because the bank made a mistake, they will refund the fees as soon as the problem gets resolved. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>A fraudulent charge is a charge on an account for an unapproved amount or an unauthorized transaction. Monitor your account daily for fraudulent charges and report any suspicious charges immediately. With credit cards, you are not liable for the charges until the investigation ends. </p>

				<h2>5.4: Reporting Lost or Stolen Bank Cards or Checks</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>
						Some banks will deem you responsible for a portion of the fraudulent charge if you are slow to report the missing card. Below is a quick guide for what to do in the event of a lost or stolen checkbook or debit card.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Report a lost or stolen card or checkbook immediately</b>
							<p>
								For a missing checkbook, freeze the account and open a new one. While a debit card can be reissued with a different number, an account cannot. The only way to safeguard against fraudulent checks in the future is to close any accounts associated with that checkbook. You will need to make sure any outstanding checks you have written reroute to the new account.
							</p>
							<p>
								For debit cards, get the bank to cancel the lost/stolen card and order you a new one. (Some banks will issue you a temporary card while the other is mailed.) If you have bills tied to that card, contact the companies and arrange other payments.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Gather all documentation of recent purchases and information of all bills that are tied to the account.</b>
							<p>
								Having documentation of the most recent charges can help the bank determine where the legitimate charges stopped. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>In some cases, you will need to file a police report.</b>
							<p>
								This can be helpful if later on you realize that your identity was also stolen during this incident. If you think that your identity may have been compromised, contact the credit bureaus and put a security freeze on your report. If a new credit account is created within this timeline, it will not be approved and opened without a phone call made to a phone number you provided, proof of your identity, and authorization that you opened this account.

										Canceling the card is the first thing that should be done. Once the card is canceled you will need to call all accounts that are associated with that card to prevent a gap in service. You do not need to do a security freeze or cancel the account for a debit card. Once the card is deactivated it cannot access your account.

				<h2>5.5:Ways to Safeguard Your Bank Information and Identity</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>
						Not all instances of identity theft can be prevented, but there are ways to help protect yourself.
					</p>
					<h3>Protect Yourself At Home</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Monitor your account and credit report.</b>
							<p>
								Many credit card companies and banks now offer free credit score and history reports that update regularly. If you notice a new suspicious account, contact the company that opened the account as well as the credit agency to dispute it.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Shred any documents containing your personal information.</b>
							<p>
								Identity thieves will dig through trash for credit applications and other personal information. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Keep social security cards, birth certificates, and passports in a fireproof lock box in a hidden location.</b>
							<p>
								The box will keep the documents safe from a fire and, if kept out of view, thieves will not have the opportunity to take the box and access the contents at their leisure.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Exercise caution when reading email or answering phone calls from unknown numbers.</b>
							<p>
								Thieves can be very persuasive and will try to get information about you using phishing scams. Remember: banks will never cold-call you and ask for sensitive information, nor will they send you unsolicited emails or mail asking for this information. 
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Protect Yourself Online</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Be careful what sites you visit.</b>
							<p>
								One wrong click can install viruses and malware on your computer that could put any information you access on that computer at risk. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Scan your computer regularly for viruses and malware.</b>
							<p>
								Some antivirus software cannot detect malware, so research before you buy or get supplemental protection against malware. Also, if you use Apple products, do not be fooled: they are not immune to viruses or malware.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Do not access bank or sensitive information on public Wi-Fi or hotspots.</b>
							<p>
								Some identity thieves will make a hotspot for free Wi-Fi and name it in a way that looks and sounds reputable, like "Public WIFI" or "UNT_WIFI," hoping someone will connect to it and access private information. Also, just because a Wi-Fi connection requires a login does not mean it is secure. Someone with even basic computer skills can hack into your signal if it is being broadcasted unencrypted. (Many restaurants and hotels do not encrypt network data being passed back and forth.)
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Do not assume that a VPN (Virtual Private Network) will protect you.</b>
							<p>
								When you access Wi-Fi, the VPN is established after the user is connected. There is a gap of a few seconds where the VPN has not taken over. During those few seconds in which packets are being sent and received, this gap leaves enough time for identity theft to occur. 
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Protect Yourself Out of the House</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Only carry what you need on your person.</b>
							<p>
								Do not carry your Social Security card. Only carry the credit cards you use and leave the others behind. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>When using an ATM, be vigilant.</b>
							<p>
								Make sure no is behind you trying to see your PIN. Look at the machine and check for skimmer devices. Skimmer devices come in all shapes and sizes, but their goal is the same: to get your information and exploit it. Skimmers can be located on the keypad and card slot, the card reader and camera, or all in one on the card slot. If you suspect that an ATM has been outfitted with a card skimming device, do not use the machine. Also, it is a good idea to shield your fingers from view as you enter your PIN. Do not recite your PIN aloud or keep it written down anywhere. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Invest in a wallet that blocks RFID scanners.</b>
							<p>
								While this is a new tactic for identity thieves and requires the scanner to be inches away from the card, new and improved scanners could potentially be created that will read at greater distances, and it is better to be protected.
							</p>

				<h2>5.6: Recognizing Counterfeit Bills</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>
						Another aspect of protecting yourself from fraud is being vigilant about the funds you accept from others. If you receive paper currency from your bank, odds are someone has checked it thoroughly for counterfeit. However, many people and businesses do not check bills so closely, or they use methods that do not always effectively spot counterfeit currency.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Hold a bill up to a light and look for the face image on the bill to appear to the right of the printed version. Both images should match.</b>
							<p>
								The watermark can be seen from both sides of the bill since it is not printed on the bill, but rather embedded in the paper.
							</p>
							<p>
								While this method can be useful, many cashiers simply look for the watermark, but do not actually take note of which face appears. A common method for counterfeiting bills is to bleach a bill of a smaller denomination and replace the ink with that of a higher dollar amount. For example, a $10 bill that has been bleached and reprinted as a $100 will show Franklin on the printed center, but Hamilton in the watermark. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>The light method will also reveal a thin vertical strip called a security thread.</b>
							<p>
								The thread contains repeating text stating the bill’s intended denomination. This strip cannot be removed from the bill. Counterfeiters may try to print a new strip over the existing one to make it unreadable.
							</p>
							<p>
								Many cashiers will check for the watermark, but never advance to this step.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the $10 and $50, the security strip is located to the right of the portrait. In the $5, $20 and $100, it is located just to the left of the portrait. 
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>When held under an ultraviolet light, each security thread will glow a specific color.</b>
							<ul>
								<li>$5 glows blue</li>
								<li>$10 glows orange</li>
								<li>$20 glows green</li>
								<li>$50 glows yellow</li>
								<li>$100 glows red</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Compare bills with other bills you know to be authentic.</b>
							<p>
								Bills that you receive from the bank are a reliable source of authentic bills. Some things to compare are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<u>Size of the bill.</u>
									<p>
										Is the bill the same size or is it slightly smaller? A bill that does not have the same dimensions may have been bleached and washed or printed from copies.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Texture of the bill.</u>
									<p>
										Authentic currency features micro-printing that raises the ink away from the paper. On portraits, the texture of the hair and jackets should feel rough. Many counterfeiters use laser printers that do not raise the ink to produce this rough texture. 
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Ink bleed.</u>
									<p>
										On authentic bills, the ink tends to look less crisp and will "bleed" away from the lettering.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<u>Cotton fibers.</u>
									<p>
										Bills are made out of a cotton "rag" paper which mixes tiny blue and red fibers into the paper. These fibers are hard to reproduce on any other type of paper. When looking at bills, remember that the authentic ones will have fibers of different sizes and lengths and will not follow any set pattern. 
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Reporting Counterfeits</h4>
					<p>
						If you think you have a counterfeit bill, take it to your bank as soon as possible. They will not be able to exchange it, but they can more easily handle reporting it to the Secret Service. If possible, try to remember where you received the bill from, since the bank can include this information on the report, which may help find the counterfeiters more easily.

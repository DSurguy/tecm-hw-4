		<h1>Chapter 1: Choosing A Bank</h1>
		<p>This is an introduction to the section. Curabitur blandit mollis lacus. Nullam dictum felis eu pede mollis 
			pretium. Fusce neque. Vivamus elementum semper nisi. Cras varius.<p>
		<p>Duis vel nibh at velit scelerisque suscipit. Mauris sollicitudin fermentum libero. Vestibulum ante ipsum 
			primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Sed aliquam, nisi quis porttitor congue, 
			elit erat euismod orci, ac placerat dolor lectus quis orci. Cras non dolor. Fusce ac felis sit amet ligula 
			pharetra condimentum.</p>
		<h3>1.1: Proximity To Work and Home</h3>
		<p>When choosing a bank, it is important to consider how often you will go to the bank and the amount of time 
			you are willing to spend driving to and from the nearest branch. A branch that is close to home or your work 
			is more beneficial than a branch that is located farther or where traffic may inhibit your ability to get 
			there quickly. The reason this should be important to you is that in the event that you need to deposit 
			funds to cover an overdraft, sign a stop payment form, or close an account due to fraud, you'll be able to 
			do so as soon as possible. This prevents potential loss of funds.</p>
		<p>You should also consider how their hours of operation work with your schedule. If a branch is close to home 
			but closes before you'll make it home from work, you might want to find a bank that is closer to work or 
			that has longer operating hours.</p>
		<h3>1.2: Number of Branches vs Customer Service</h3>
		<p>In addition to finding a bank that is located near you, you'll want to consider how many branches exist 
			around your area and across the country. Typically, this means you'll need to decide between a small local 
			bank or a larger corporate organization. There are pros and cons to each.</p>
		<p>Local banking organizations, such as Woodhaven National or Southwest Bank, typically have fewer branches 
			and are centrally located around a main operations branch. Woodhaven for example has 8 branches spread 
			across the DFW Metroplex. Local banks typically have slightly lower interest rates, but can more closely 
			monitor your accounts for possible fraud. Many small banks avoid "selling" to their customers.</p>
		<p>Larger corporate banks, such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo, will have branches located all across 
			the country and even in foreign countries. Having so many branches available is helpful if you have an 
			issue while on vacation or travelling. The downside to these larger banks is that your experience is less 
			personalized to your needs and you may not be able to speak to an actual person without walking into a 
			branch. Many of the bigger branches use automated phone systems.</p>
		<h3>1.3: Minimum Balances</h3>
		<p>Next, you'll want to consider the amount of money required to open an account as well as the minimum 
			balance requirements to avoid fees and service charges. The amount of money you have and the amount of 
			money that is tied up by these balance requirements may determine whether or not you choose a particular 
			account. Ideally, you want an account that has either no minimum or a very small minimum, such as $25.00 
			or $50.00.</p>
		<h3>1.4: Monthly Fees and Service Fees</h3>
		<p>Typically related directly to the minimum balance requirements, monthly fees and service fees are calculated 
			and charged differently at each bank.</p>
		<p>One way of assessing the imposition of fees is to calculate the total daily balance for each statement cycle. 
			If the daily balance falls below a predetermined amount on any single day in the statement cycle, the 
			bank imposes a fee on that month's statement. The fee can vary by bank as well as by the severity of the 
			difference in your daily balance versus the predetermined limit.</p>
		<p>For Example: Bank A has a minimum daily balance requirement of $1,000.00. The bank imposes a fee of $8.00 
			if an account falls below $500.00 on any single day in the statement cycle. However, if an account only 
			falls below $750.00, the fee is reduced to $5.00 in that statement cycle.</p>
		<p>Other banks may charge a flat fee on all accounts of a certain type, but may allow customers opportunities 
			to reduce that fee by completing certain actions.</p>
		<p>For Example: Bank B charges a monthly flat rate fee of $7.00 on all Select 4 Checking accounts. Customers 
			may sign up for internet banking to reduce the fee by $2.00 and set up Direct Deposit to reduce the fee 
			an additional $2.00. Thus, the customer could reduce the fee to $3.00 monthly.</p>
		<p>Additional service fees may include having Cashier's Checks or Money Orders printed, wiring funds to another 
			bank, or replacing lost ATM cards. These fees will also vary by bank so it's important to read these 
			conditions before signing paperwork for an account.</p>
